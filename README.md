This repository was part of the initial attempt at writing nanoc 4. That attempt did not go as initially planned, and was cancelled mid May 2015.

Do not despair! There is a _true_ nanoc 4, and it lives in the [nanoc/nanoc repository](http://github.com/nanoc/nanoc). For information about nanoc 4 and how to upgrade, consult the [nanoc 4 upgrade guide](http://nanoc.ws/docs/nanoc-4-upgrade-guide/).
